</div><div class='unindent'><br />HE papa who writes this biography of a bubble
never wrote a biography before in all his life.
This is his first printed work. Perhaps some
old person will criticise it severely.</div>

<p>"Why use such big words as 'biography'
and 'criticise'?" this old person may ask. "Are you not
writing for little people? Is not your subject a poor little
bubble that could not have lived longer than three or four
seconds?"</p>

<p>To which this papa replies: "Old person, do not meddle.
This papa knows what he is about. The little folks understand
very well that a 'biography' is a story of a life; that
to 'criticise' is to find fault; and that a 'critic' is a fault-finder."</p>

<p>So all critics will please get out of the way, and leave
this papa alone while he writes the biography of a bubble.</p>

<p>This bubble was born just as the clock struck four, on the
afternoon of the 13th of January, 1873. Its name was
"Diamond."</p>

<p>"Why, how could a bubble have a name?"</p>

<p>Now, you just be quiet and patient, and in good time
you shall learn all. Papa had promised his little daughter
Grace, that one of these days he would blow some bubbles
for her amusement.</p>

<p>Grace reminded him several times of his promise; but
papa was always too busy to attend to it. At last Grace
said, "When will <i>one of these days</i> come?"&mdash;"It shall
come now," said papa.</p>

<p>So he got a pipe, and a bowl of soap-suds; and Grace stood
at his knee while he blew bubbles. Grace was delighted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
"Name them," said she; for papa had named her kittens,
and she thought he could name the bubbles.</p>

<p>The first one's name was "Sparkle." It was a very big
bubble; but it did not live long. The name of the second
was "Glory." I think it might have lived a second longer
than it did, if Grace had not touched it with her finger.</p>

<p>The third bubble floated up almost to the ceiling. Its
name was "Napoleon." It rose as bravely as if it had no fear
of breaking. It expired of old age, after reaching the term
of ten seconds and a half.</p>

<p>At last, just as the clock struck four, little "Diamond" appeared.
She was a delicate little thing, and bright with all
the colors of the rainbow. She was not proud like the other
bubbles. She did not try to mount. Perhaps papa's breath
made her go as she did.</p>

<p>Grace admired "Diamond" very much. "Why, see, papa!
She is coming to kiss me," said the little girl;&mdash;"she is on
my cheek."</p>

<p>Yes, little "Diamond" ended her life on the cheek of innocence.
What better end could she have had? Was it not
much better than mounting to the cold, white ceiling, and
living to a dull old age, like the big bubble whose name
was Napoleon?</p>

"<span class="smcap">This</span> is our grand menagerie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Beneath the crooked cherry-tree.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The exhibition now begins:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Admittance, only thirteen pins;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And if the pins you cannot borrow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Why, then, we'll trust you till to-morrow.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Don't be afraid to walk inside:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The animals are safely tied.</span><br />
<br />
"This is the elephant on the right:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Don't meddle with him, or he'll bite.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">(He's Rover, Neddie's dog, you know.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I wish he wouldn't fidget so!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He doesn't think it fun to play</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Wild beast, and be chained up all day.)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We'll feed him, pretty soon, with meat;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Though grass is what he ought to eat.</span><br />
<br />
"In that box are the kangaroos:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Go near and pat them if you choose;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">(They're very much like Susie's rabbits,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With just a change of name and habits.)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You'll find them lively as a top:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">See, when I poke them, how they hop.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They are not fierce; but, oh! take care:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We now approach the grizzly bear.</span><br />
<br />
"See her long claws, and only hear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Her awful growl when I go near!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We found her lying on a rug,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And just escaped her fearful hug.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">It took some time to get her caged:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">She's terrible when she's enraged.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">(You think, perhaps, it's Mabel's cat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But don't you be too sure of that!)</span><br />
<br />
"Here is the ostrich in her pen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">(It's Ernest's little bantam-hen):</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">She came from Africa, of course,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And runs as fast as any horse;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And up above there is a bird</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of whom you all have often heard,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The eagle ('That is not,' says Mary,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'A pretty name for my canary')."</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Just at this point, I grieve to say,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The elephant broke quite away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">O'erthrew the grizzly bear in rage,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Upset the eagle in his cage,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Flew at the kangaroos, and then</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Attacked the ostrich in her pen.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thus ended Jack's menagerie</span><br />

<h2>THE STORY OF A LITTLE DUCK.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> one of a family of nine brothers and sisters. We all
found ourselves outside our shells one fine, sunny day in
spring; but we felt chilly, and were glad to nestle under the
wings of the kind old hen whom we regarded as our mother.</p>

<p>In a day or two, we began to look about the world. We
found that it comprised a pretty lawn, on which our mansion
was placed, with a brick wall at one end of it. The other
end of the world was at the foot of the lawn, and consisted
of a level expanse as smooth as a sheet of glass.</p>

<p>Our mansion was formed of wood, with a high pointed
roof, and with open bars in front, through which we could
look out and enjoy the prospect. We could crawl under
the bars easily; but mother-hen could not.</p>

<p>One day a great, strong giant came and lifted up our
mansion right over our heads. This giant had two legs,
but no wings. Poor thing! They called him a <i>little boy</i>.
He frightened us very much at first; but as he fed us, and
called us, "Ducky, ducky!" we soon grew fond of him.</p>

<p>When the boy had lifted up our mansion (which he
called a coop), mother-hen started at once on a journey
round the world. We stopped to pick up some bits of
grain, and some little worms, which we found. "Cluck,
cluck!" said mother-hen, which means, "Come, come!" and
we all said, "Quack, quack!" which means, "Yes, yes!"</p>

<p>On we went, threading our way through the forest of
grass; and our ideas were much enlarged by finding that
the world comprised a vast farm-yard as well as our lawn,
and the distant glass-like boundary. On we went, "Cluck,
cluck! quack, quack!" and at last found ourselves close to
the smooth expanse, which we learned was called a <i>pond</i>,
and composed of a beautiful liquid called "water."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Into this pond my brothers and sisters dashed, and of
course I followed. How delicious! The water was cool
and refreshing, and so buoyant, that we moved about on it
more easily than we could walk on the land; but, when we
looked back to the bank, we saw mother-hen calling out in
grief and dread, "Cluck, cluck! come, come! you'll drown,
drown! Oh, oh!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 296px;">
<img src="images/illus038.jpg" width="296" height="350" alt="Poor mother-hen" title="Poor mother-hen" />
</div>

<p>"All right!" said my eldest brother; "no fear: here we
are as jolly as sandboys! You may as well come. It's
capital. Here goes for a dive!" And, so saying, under he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
went, and soon came up again, laughing, "Quack, quack!
oh, it's <i>so</i> jolly!"</p>

<p>But poor mother-hen did not see any thing jolly about it,
and was always in fear when we went to the pond, into
which she would never go herself.</p>

<p>In time we grew up, and found that we could actually <i>fly
in the air</i>. Oh, capital! When that horrible monster with
four legs, which they called "a dog," ran after us, we opened
our wings, and flew over the lawn to the pond. And there
stood the stupid dog bawling out, "Bow, wow! bow, wow!"</p>

<p>One day our ideas were again expanded by our being
driven through a gate. We then found that the world was
much larger than we had thought; for beyond our wall
was a broad ploughed field, as well as a vast forest, the edges
of which touched the distant sky. Wonderful discovery!
How grand a duck feels when gaining useful knowledge!</p>

<p>Every thing went on pleasantly enough, until a great
awkward giant, named Bob, came and looked very hard at
us. At first we did not like him; but he was really very
kind, and called us "Ducky, ducky, ducky!" and threw us
handfuls of barley. He then seized two or three of my
fattest brothers and sisters, and frightened them so much,
that they called out, "Quack, quack! don't, don't!" But
they need not have made such a fuss, as he put them safely
in a basket with a lid to it to keep off the rain, and took
a great deal of care of them indeed.</p>

<p>How kind of him to take the trouble to carry them in
this basket on his arm, instead of leaving them to waddle
along the road! In this way he has taken all my brothers
and sisters away with him, except myself and my brother
little Jack Drake. I dare say he will soon take <i>us</i> with him
in his nice basket.</p>

<p>Certainly it is a good thing to have men to attend to us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
so well. I am sure they must be very fond of ducks to
take such care of us. And so I said to Jack Drake; but all
he said in reply was, "Quack, quack! quack, quack!"</p>

<h2>OUR THANKSGIVING DINNER.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> live in a little village near the city of Cincinnati.
We have not lived here many years; and our grandparents
and aunts and uncles and cousins are so far away, that they
cannot often come to see us.</p>

<p>This year, on Thanksgiving Day, none of our friends were
with us; and mamma and papa felt very sad to have the
big turkey cooked, and only our own family to eat it.</p>

<p>So, happening to see a ragged little boy in the street,
mamma called him, and told him to go out and find eleven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
more poor little boys, and tell them to come with him and
get a Thanksgiving dinner.</p>

<p>He ran off in high glee; and, sure enough, when twelve
o'clock came, along came the whole number of poor, hungry
little boys. Their eyes sparkled with delight when
they saw the nice brown turkey, and the pies and cakes.
They were soon seated at the table; and papa and mamma
waited on them.</p>

<p>It made us all glad to see how the poor fellows enjoyed
their dinner. One ragged little boy was so afraid of soiling
the cloth, that he quietly slipped the bones under the table.
Another boy saw him, and told the rest; and then they all
had a good laugh.</p>

<p>After they had eaten as much as they wanted, they were
taken into the room where the piano is; and mamma got
"The Nursery" containing the song of "Mother Hubbard,"
and played and sung it to them.</p>

<p>Papa then gave each one a paper of candy and a nice
large apple, and sent them off. No sooner were they out of
the door than they set up a yell like so many little Indians,
and ran to their homes as fast as they could, I suppose, to
tell about the good time they had had.</p>

<p>We all think now that we enjoyed our Thanksgiving
as well as children who had their own friends to dine with
them. And I do not doubt that those poor little boys will
remember their unexpected dinner as long as they live.</p>

<h2>THE GRANDPA STORY.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Which</span> shall it be to-night, Harry?" I said a little while
ago?&mdash;"The Goblet Story, The Grandpa Story, or About
the Runaway Boy?"</p>

<p>"Oh! The Grandpa Story," said Harry at once; "for
grandpa has been here to-day, and brought me ten notched
sugar-plums,&mdash;five red ones, and five white." So I began:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>One bright Monday morning, I looked out of the front-window, and
said, "Why, Harry, Uncle David has come to town! He is tying his
horse under the elm-tree." A minute after, Uncle David opened the door
into the sitting-room, and said, "Is there any one here who would like to
go out to grandpa's to-day?" And mamma spoke right up, and said,
"We would all like to go. It will do my little lads good to have a nice
ride."</p>

<p>"Get ready quick, then," said Uncle David. So mamma put a little
blue cloak and a white sun-bonnet on Freddy the baby, and a linen coat,
and straw hat with blue ribbons on Harry; and they all went out, and got
into the carriage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Then away they rode through the pretty streets, and over a covered
bridge, where the horse went <span class="smcap">trot</span>, <span class="smcap">trot</span>, <span class="smcap">trot</span>. Then they crossed a
railroad-track, and drove past a station, and
stopped at a store; and Uncle David went in
and bought a great box of sugar for Aunt
Mattie, and a little bag of candy to carry home
to his little boy Philly.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illus043a.png" width="200" height="176" alt="A man with a gun" title="A man with a gun" />
</div>

<p>Then they rode up a steep hill, and came out
upon Westfield Plains. And then what beautiful
things they saw!&mdash;a man with a gun, a
squirrel cracking a nut, a little girl with red
hair, a man picking apples from a tree, and, best of all, a boy flying a kite.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illus043b.png" width="200" height="183" alt="A man picking apples" title="A man picking apples" />
</div>

<p>By and by they drove up a hill to grandpa's house. Cousin Philly, who
was out on the piazza, ran into the house to
tell his mamma that Aunt Susan had come,
and brought all her little boys with her.</p>

<p>Tiger, the great black dog, said, "Bow,
wow!" to Harry, as he went up the steps.
Cousin Anne sat in a great rocking-chair by
the open window, and sang to her dolly,
"Rock-a-by baby."</p>

<p>Aunt Mattie was glad enough to see them,
and gave Harry a round cooky with a hole in the middle, that he thought
very funny. Mamma always makes square cookies, with no holes to put
your fingers through.</p>

<p>By and by, when grandpa came in from the
orchard, they had a nice supper. They had
peaches and cream, and biscuits and honey;
and, oh! how good every thing tasted!</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illus043c.png" width="200" height="172" alt="A boy flying a kite" title="A boy flying a kite" />
</div>

<p>Philly lent Harry his cup with the picture
of a queen on one side, and "<i>Remember me</i>"
on the other; and Harry drank two cups of
milk, the cup was so pretty.</p>

<p>After supper Harry's eyes began to droop;
and so mamma said, "Kiss grandpa, my little boy, and the dear little
cousins, and then let's run to bed with sleepy head."</p>

<p>In six seconds after Harry's head touched the pillow, he was fast
asleep.</p>

<p>The next morning he awoke fresh and bright; and, after breakfast,
Philly and Harry went out into the road to play. They made little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
sand-hills and houses of pebble-stones, and dug wells in the sand, and had
a real good time.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, mamma put the cloaks and hats on Harry and Freddy;
Uncle David drove up to the house; and they all got into the carriage, and
had a nice ride home.</p></div>

<h2>JACK FROST.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span>, he is with us again;<br />
He comes every winter, you know:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But we're hardy and bold,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we don't mind the cold,</span><br />
And we welcome the ice and the snow.<br />
<br />
Jack Frost plays a rough sort of game<br />
With the children wherever he goes:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He pinches their cheeks;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their noses he tweaks;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>And he treads on their ten little toes.<br />
<br />
Jack Frost makes the ground rather hard:<br />
But with thick boots we clatter about;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we run till our breath</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Puffs away like a wreath</span><br />
Of white steam from the teakettle's spout.<br />
<br />
Jack Frost lays his hand on the pond,<br />
And turns it to glittering ice;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then the skaters they glide,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the sliders they slide:</span><br />
Think of that, Charley; isn't it nice!<br />
<br />
Jack Frost, he is sure to be found<br />
Where the sleigh-bells are tinkling clear;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the horses, so strong,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Canter gayly along,</span><br />
While the lads give a shout and a cheer.<br />
<br />
Jack Frost, then, you're welcome again;<br />
Of pleasures you bring us a store:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But be mild as you can,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, you fierce little man!</span><br />
When you visit the feeble and poor.<br />

<h2>MISS JONES'S PICTURE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> just been looking at Miss Jones's picture. How
do you think Miss Jones looks?</p>

<p>She wears a shawl pinned close up to her throat, a cap
tied under her chin, and a pair of spectacles over some very
wise-looking eyes.</p>

<p>What a funny-looking picture! I call it a funny picture,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
because the clothes are an old lady's clothes; but the face
is a little girl's face, round and plump and rosy. If I could
take off the cap and the shawl and the spectacles, I should
see a little girl of four years, with a white dress, a pink sash,
and long curls hanging down over her shoulders.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus046.png" width="350" height="352" alt="Miss Jones" title="Miss Jones" />
</div>

<p>Her name is Edith May. Her mamma calls her Edie.
Edie likes to fix herself up, and "play people" as she calls
it. She takes many different parts.</p>

<p>Sometimes she is an old lady, and sometimes she is a
young lady. Sometimes she plays she is mamma; and then
she runs round taking care of her dollies, and says she
doesn't know what she <i>shall</i> do now that Tilly has the
measles, and Hannah has the chicken-pox, and she <i>verily</i>
believes that the baby has the measles too.</p>

<p>The other day, she said she was going to be Miss Jones,
and go down to the saloon and have her picture taken.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>So she fixed herself up with cap and spectacles and shawl,
and went down to the photograph-room, and told the artist
that she was Miss Jones, and she had called to have her
picture taken.</p>

<p>Then the artist placed a chair for her, and she sat up as
straight as she could. When the pictures were finished, he
sent them to her mamma, who has sent one to me; and
here you have it in "The Nursery."</p>

<h2>SUE'S SEASONS.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">In</span> the spring, when the leaves all start,<br />
The crocus thrills at its glowing heart,<br />
The windflower opens its tinted cup,<br />
While the sap mounts merrily up and up.<br />
<br />
In the spring all the birds begin,<br />
Early and late to build and sing:<br />
Sweeter music was never heard<br />
Then the merry note of a building bird.<br />
<br />
In the summer the roses smile,<br />
Painting the roadside, mile by mile;<br />
The sweet-brier catches you as you pass,<br />
The violets thicken among the grass;<br />
<br />
Little nests run over with song,<br />
Little wings grow restless and strong;<br />
Daisies shine in the fields afar,<br />
Odors float where the lilies are.<br />
<br />
In the autumn the sap runs down,<br />
And leaves are tinted with gold and brown:<br />
In the winter when wild winds blow,<br />
The leaves are dead in a shroud of snow.<br />

<h2>"CLEAR THE COAST!"</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I told</span> you last month how Robert hoped that Santa Claus
would bring him a sled; and how Robert woke on Christmas
morning to find by his bedside a beautiful sled, painted red,
with thick iron runners.</p>

<p>The next day he went with Uncle Charles to the hill on
Boston Common, near Park Street, to see the boys coast.
Here is a picture of the scene, drawn from life; and a very
correct idea it will give you of the sport that may be witnessed
in Boston after every snow-storm.</p>

<p>Robert had his sled with him; and as he stood with Uncle
Charles, looking at the coasters, the little boy longed to be
<i>of</i> them and <i>among</i> them. But Uncle Charles said, "You
are not quite old enough yet to coast in public: you have
not had practice enough."</p>

<p>Then a big boy, who had been admiring Robert's sled,
stepped up and said, "I should like to try that sled, sir: I
can take the little fellow on the sled in front of me. I will
take good care of him, sir."</p>

<p>Robert begged so hard to take his first lesson in coasting
under the care of this big boy, that Uncle Charles at last
consented; and in the picture you may see Uncle Charles
waiting for the two boys to come along on the sled.</p>

<p>He could not see them at first: but in about five minutes
down they came like the rush of a torrent; and little Robert,
as he saw Uncle Charles, cried out as loud as he could,
"Clear the coast, clear the coast!"</p>

<p>Uncle Charles clapped his hands; the ladies waved their
handkerchiefs; and Robert felt quite proud, when, as he
reached the bottom of the hill, some boys gathered round,
and pronounced his sled "a first-rate runner."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>That was a proud day for Robert; for, before he left the
Common, he was allowed to coast once all alone; and he did
it in such good style, that the big boy told him he would
make a "prime coaster."</p>

<p>"What did he mean by a "<i>prime coaster</i>"<i>?</i>" asked Robert.
"He meant," said Uncle Charles, "that, with a little more
practice, you will coast very well,&mdash;as well, perhaps, as he
does himself."</p>

<h2>OUR NEW DOG.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have a new dog. His name is Bright. He is only
two years old. His master one day took the cars near our
place for California; and poor Bright was left behind.</p>

<p>I met him at the railroad-station. He seemed to be in
great distress. I had some bread in my hand, and offered
him a piece. He was too sad to eat. I patted him on the
head, and said, "Poor doggie, have you lost your master?"</p>

<p>Bright howled as if he understood my question; and I
believe he did. When I got home that day, I found that he
had followed me. As I stood on the door-step, he fawned
at my feet, and made a low, imploring noise, as if he would
like to say, "Do be my master, and let me be your dog: I
will be such a good dog!"</p>

<p>I understood what he wanted, and said, "Well, old fellow,
you shall have your wish. I adopt you as my own dog."</p>

<p>Thereupon Bright wagged his tail, and barked, and put his
fore-feet on my shoulders, and tried to lick my face. We
understood each other now completely.</p>

<p>Bright seemed to understand that he must not only be
good to me, but to all under my care. I had a little white
kitten named Snow-drop. When she and Bright first met,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
she was so much afraid, that she leaped up on top of the
bookcase to be out of his way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 205px;">
<img src="images/illus051.png" width="205" height="300" alt="Bright trying to coax Snow-drop down" title="Bright trying to coax Snow-drop down" />
</div>

<p>It was amusing to see how he tried to coax her down, and
to make her feel that he was her friend. Snow-drop mewed,
and raised her back; but Bright, by some good-natured
half-barks and playful grunts, soon made her understand
that he was one of the family, and bound to treat her well.</p>

<p>By and by Snow-drop left off mewing, and began to purr.
Bright lay down on the carpet, and began flapping and brushing
it in a half-circle with his tail. That meant play.</p>

<p>So Kitty at last came down; and, when I left the room, she
and Bright were having a grand frolic together. I know
you would like my dog Bright if you could see him.</p>

My white cups and saucers that came Christmas Day<br />

We've got a <i>whole</i> orange, and three macaroons,<br />
And some <i>blue</i>-mange&mdash;we'll eat it with Hatty's new spoons;<br />

Hatty'll sit at one end, and the other you'll take;<br />
And I'll cut the orange, and she'll help the cake:<br />
You'll see something funny&mdash;the reason, don't ask it&mdash;<br />
When we've eaten the cake, we can eat up the basket!<br />
<br />
We invited the dolls; but they both have the mumps;<br />
And yesterday mine got two terrible bumps:<br />
So we left them in bed; and I do not much care,<br />
For dolls never <i>will</i> sit up straight on a chair.<br />
<br />
Then, nicest of all, when our party is done,<br />
We'll wash up the dishes; and won't that be fun!<br />
Then scrub sticky fingers and sugary thumbs;<br />
And the sparrows and robins may clear up the crumbs.<br />

<h2>DANDY THE BEAR.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have a dancing bear in our village. His name is
Dandy. He belongs to Mr. Werner, a German, who leads
him about the streets, and makes a show of him. We children<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
all give Dandy some of our spare cents when we see
him; for a bear has to be fed like you and me.</p>

<p>"Come, Dandy," Mr. Werner will say, "here are the
young ladies and gentlemen, all with plenty of cents in
their pockets to give you if you perform well. They are
good judges of high art. They can admire the poetry of
motion. So do your prettiest."</p>

<p>Mr. Werner has a monkey and a pet dog. The monkey
is called Captain. He wears a hat with a feather in it. The
name of the pet dog is Grip. He is fat and greedy; and, if
he sees a boy with a cake, he begs for a piece of it; indeed,
he wouldn't object to the whole of it. I wonder if you can
spy out Grip and the Captain in the picture.</p>

<p>But Dandy makes more fun for us than all the rest.
"Now, Dandy," Mr. Werner will say, "make your most
stunning bow to the ladies, and then give us a turn on the
light fantastic."</p>

<p>By the "light fantastic," Mr. Werner means "the light
fantastic toe." He has made this joke so many times, that
we know what he means by it.</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, Dandy will bow, raise himself on one
of his hind-feet, and whirl round in a <i>pirouette</i>. (If you do
not know what a <i>pirouette</i> is, you must get some one to explain

<p>You would laugh to see Dandy imitate the great dancers.
Though he can hardly be called graceful, he is very amusing;
and we children willingly pay for the sight a cent each

<h2>LITTLE MISCHIEF.</h2>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Bessie</span> went to pass a week with her Aunt Clara and
Uncle Frank. Uncle Frank was a portrait-painter. One
day Bessie took her doll Cornelia, and went into his studio.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 278px;">
<img src="images/illus057.png" width="278" height="300" alt="Looking at the portrait" title="Looking at the portrait" />
</div>

<p>On the easel stood a portrait. Bessie looked at it, and
thought it must be a likeness of her friend Col. Fraser.
"But," said she, "the mustache is too faint: it wants paint."</p>

<p>Then she remembered hearing her uncle say that he had
more work than he could attend to. "What if I do a little
work for him, and so give him a surprise!" thought she.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>"Uncle Frank, when he is by, never lets me touch his
paints," said Bessie to herself; "but that must be because
he does not know how clever I am. Nothing can be easier
to paint than a mustache. It is only a number of hairs."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 280px;">
<img src="images/illus058.png" width="280" height="300" alt="Into the paints" title="Into the paints" />
</div>

<p>So Bessie climbed up into her uncle's chair, and took one
of his long brushes in her hand. Then she looked at the
colors on the palette, and tried to mix the blue and red as
she had seen Uncle Frank do.</p>

<p>The long brush was hard to manage. However, she
remembered the rhyme, "Try, try, try again;" and she
worked away until she thought she had got the tint.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>At last Bessie was ready to begin her great work. So,
standing on tiptoe, she applied the brush to the upper-lip.
She was determined, while she was about it, to give Col.
Fraser a thoroughly good mustache, long and thick.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 280px;">
<img src="images/illus059.png" width="280" height="300" alt="Fixing the portrait" title="Fixing the portrait" />
</div>

<p>Now and then she would step back a little way, and consider
the picture from a distance, as she had seen her uncle
do. She was well pleased with her work. It was certainly
a great improvement: so Bessie thought.</p>

<p>At last she laid down her brush. She felt quite charmed
with her success, and picked up her doll off the floor, that
she might see how well her little mamma could paint.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>"It is beautiful! Is it not, Cornelia?" she said, as she
threw herself back in the chair. "Uncle will never say
again that I cannot paint. Perhaps it is more blue than
Col. Fraser's mustache; but it is all the prettier for that."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 374px;">
<img src="images/illus060.png" width="374" height="400" alt="Admiring her work" title="Admiring her work" />
</div>

<p>Bessie remembered, too, that her mamma had once read
to her a story about a man with a blue beard. "So people
<i>do</i> have blue mustaches sometimes," thought she.</p>

<p>What did Uncle Frank say when he saw what she had
done? I am sorry to say he did not agree with Bessie that
the picture was improved. At first he was vexed; then he
laughed; then he gave Bessie a kiss.</p>

</div>
<h2>TOO MANY PRESENTS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Did</span> you ever hear of the boy who had a drum and a
trumpet and a rocking-horse for his Christmas presents, and
cried, after all, because Santa Claus had given his sister a
doll, and hadn't given him one?</p>

<p>I have heard of that boy; but, to tell the truth, I doubt
the whole story. It is a little too tough for me. I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
believe there ever was such a boy; and I won't believe in
him until I see him.</p>

<p>But I did know a little boy who <i>almost</i> cried because he
had <i>no</i> Christmas present. He was a good boy too. He
would have been pleased with any thing; and it was too bad
that Santa Claus forgot to bring some little gift for him.</p>

<p>The queerest case, though, is that of the little boy whose
picture we have here. You see him just as he looked on
Christmas morning, with his presents all around him; and
yet you see he does not look happy. What can be the
matter with the child?</p>

<p>Ah! the trouble is, that he has too many presents. He
has so many that he doesn't know what to do with them.
He doesn't know which to play with first. He is afraid all
the time that some of them will get lost. And so, by trying
to enjoy them all at once, he fails to enjoy them at all.</p>

<p>Poor boy! he is having a hard time of it, and I pity him
very much. If I were going to prescribe for him, this is
what I should say, "Tom, my boy" (I know by his looks
that his name is Tom), "don't be cast down. I'll show you
the way out of your trouble. Your case is pretty bad; but
there's a remedy. What you want to do is to <i>give away</i>
something.</p>

<p>"Now, there's that doll that you are hugging so closely.
What does a boy like you want of a doll? That must have
been meant for some little girl. It was sent to you on purpose
to give away. Of course it was.</p>

<p>"Then there are those two wagons. You don't want
both of them. You know you don't. Find the boy who
hadn't any Christmas presents, and give one of the wagons
to him. Let that wooden soldier go with it; for what do
you want of a soldier, when you have a gun of your own?</p>

<p>"And what if you should give away something that you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
do want very much; why, it wouldn't hurt you a bit: you
would feel all the better for it. Just try now, Tom, and
see if you wouldn't."</p>

<p>Perhaps the little boy would take my advice; and perhaps
he wouldn't, but, if he should, I'm sure he would make
a much more cheerful picture than he does now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A dog</span>, crossing a bridge with a piece of meat in his
mouth, saw in the water what he took to be another dog,
with a piece of meat twice the size of his own. Letting go
his own, he flew at the other dog to get the larger piece
from him. He thus lost both,&mdash;that which he grasped at
in the water, because it was a shadow; and his own, because
the stream swept it away.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
